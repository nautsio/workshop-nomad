# Failures
What happens if...
* We kill job?
* We kill a Nomad client?
* We kill a Nomad server?
* We kill a VM?
* We restart after all Nomad servers went down?
* We exhaust the resources on a node?

*Are resource limits hard? How are they enforced? Via Docker resource limits? Via cgroups in 'exec' driver?*
